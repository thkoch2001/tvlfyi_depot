//! Example implementation of a lockable door in Finito
//!
//! # What & why?
//!
//! This module serves as a (hopefully simple) example of how to
//! implement finite-state machines using Finito. Note that the
//! concepts of Finito itself won't be explained in detail here,
//! consult its library documentation for that.
//!
//! Reading through this module should give you a rough idea of how to
//! work with Finito and get you up and running modeling things
//! *quickly*.
//!
//! Note: The generated documentation for this module will display the
//! various components of the door, but it will not inform you about
//! the actual transition logic and all that stuff. Read the source,
//! too!
//!
//! # The Door
//!
//! My favourite example when explaining these state-machines
//! conceptually has been to use a simple, lockable door. Our door has
//! a keypad next to it which can be used to lock the door by entering
//! a code, after which the same code must be entered to unlock it
//! again.
//!
//! The door can only be locked if it is closed. Oh, and it has a few
//! extra features:
//!
//! * whenever the door's state changes, an IRC channel receives a
//!   message about that
//!
//! * the door calls the police if the code is intered incorrectly more
//!   than a specified number of times (mhm, lets say, three)
//!
//! * if the police is called the door can not be interacted with
//!   anymore (and honestly, for the sake of this example, we don't
//!   care how its functionality is restored)
//!
//! ## The Door - Visualized
//!
//! Here's a rough attempt at drawing a state diagram in ASCII. The
//! bracketed words denote states, the arrows denote events:
//!
//! ```text
//!          <--Open---    <--Unlock-- correct code? --Unlock-->
//!      [Opened]    [Closed]            [Locked]            [Disabled]
//!          --Close-->    ----Lock-->
//! ```
//!
//! I'm so sorry for that drawing.
//!
//! ## The Door - Usage example
//!
//! An interaction session with our final door could look like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use finito_postgres::{insert_machine, advance};
//!
//! let door = insert_machine(&conn, &DoorState::Opened)?;
//!
//! advance(&conn, &door, DoorEvent::Close)?;
//! advance(&conn, &door, DoorEvent::Lock(1337))?;
//!
//! format!("Door is now: {}", get_machine(&conn, &door)?);
//! ```
//!
//! Here we have created, closed and then locked a door and inspected
//! its state. We will see that it is locked, has the locking code we
//! gave it and three remaining attempts to open it.
//!
//! Alright, enough foreplay, lets dive in!
