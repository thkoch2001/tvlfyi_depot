      "message": "An overall thought I have is that the protocol might not want to dictate the type of hash used at all, i.e. blob identifiers should be treated as opaque strings in the protocol and be up to the store implementation.\n\nThis would make it fairly easy for someone to implement an \"inefficient but simple\" file-backed store.",

      "message": "so the maximum size of a blob is equivalent to the maximum size of a proto message? that implies mandatory chunking, which I definitely think is a step too far for the API (it basically makes it impossible for anyone to reasonably reimplement it as an experiment), or does this turn into a stream somewhere?",
