Thanks to @sterni for prodding me to find a way to do that.\n\nLatest patchset also does a better job of compiling closures: an `Rc\u003cRefCell\u003c\u003e\u003e` is now created only for closures which do not have self-references or deferred upvalues, instead of for *all* closures.  This should allow more accurate aliasing analysis from rustc and eliminate a bunch of heap allocations.",
