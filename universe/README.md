This is my mono-repo. Having a personal mono-repo is a new idea for me, so at
the time of this writing, the state of this repository is fledgling.

I'm attempting to amass a collection of functions across a variety of languages
while minimizing the costs of sharing the code across a projects. Stay tuned for
more updates as my definition of the mono-repo becomes more clear, my opinions
evolve, and my preferences change.
