      "message": "Did you take a look at how to extend `object_store` to use it too?\n\nI only saw https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/struct.ClientOptions.html#method.with_default_headers, but no way to plug in a reqwest middleware - even though they\u0027re using it under the hood.\n\nMight be worth opening an issue upstream to open that.\n\nI\u0027m not convinced yet we should send W3C trace contexts there by default - after all, [everyone seems to require their own header formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/tracing_requests_using_xray.html), so we might need to make it configurable at some point, but I feel like we should at least make sure we have an option to do so with the `object_store` crate.",
