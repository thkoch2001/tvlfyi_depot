      "message": "Hm, a few thoughts:\n\n1. I don\u0027t really like the use of hooks here. We already have hooks on the agent level and this makes things a little more confusing. Could be solved by duplicating the path or setting it as a Buildkite build variable.\n\n2. I\u0027m not sure if this is an improvement overall. Personally I\u0027m fine with the fallback to evaluation (GC currently only happens ~once per week). The evaluation fallback also makes it easier to distribute this to other machines if there are more agents (which would be a problem with this, I think?). What are your thoughts?",
