# Nix Utils

Nix is useful and well-designed in many cases. Nix's standard library of is not
a representative example of the value of Nix. I'm hoping to replace some of the
standard library functions with versions that I find more intuitive and
ergonomic to consume.

This directcory is where I will host that work.
