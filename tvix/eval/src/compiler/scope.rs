//! This module implements the scope-tracking logic of the Tvix
//! compiler.
//!
//! Scoping in Nix is fairly complicated, there are features like
//! mutually recursive bindings, `with`, upvalue capturing, and so
//! on that introduce a fair bit of complexity.
//!
//! Tvix attempts to do as much of the heavy lifting of this at
//! compile time, and leave the runtime to mostly deal with known
//! stack indices. To do this, the compiler simulates where locals
//! will be at runtime using the data structures implemented here.
