# This Cargo file is a workspace configuration as per
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html
#
# We add this file to get a coherent set of dependencies across Tvix
# crates by sharing a Cargo.lock. This is necessary because of the
# currently limited support for Rust builds in Nix.
#
# Note that this explicitly does *not* mean that //tvix should be
# considered "one project": This is simply a workaround for a
# technical limitation and it should be our aim to remove this
# workspace file and make the subprojects independent.
#
# Note also that CI targets for actual projects should *not* be tied
# to //tvix, but to its subprojects. A potential file at
# //tvix/default.nix should likely *not* expose anything other than
# extra steps or other auxiliary targets.
