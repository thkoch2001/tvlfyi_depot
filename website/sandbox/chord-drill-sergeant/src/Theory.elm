{-| Notes are the individuals sounds that we use to create music. Think: "do re
mi fa so la ti do".

Note: Technically a "C-sharp" is also a "D-flat", but I will model accidentals
(i.e. sharps and flats) as sharps and represent the ambiguity when I render the
underlying state of the application.

Note: There are "notes" like A, B, D-flat, and then there are notes like "middle
C", also denoted in scientific pitch notation as C4. I'm unsure of what to call
each of these, and my application does not model scientific pitch notation yet,
so these non-scientific pitch denote values are "notes" for now.
