# Typo-po

Have you ever published a blog post with typos? Or perhaps you've shared a blog
post draft with a group of friends to solicit their feedback. If anyone reads
your blog post and finds places where they can correct your typos or suggest
grammatical improvements they can use typo-po.

## What's with the name?

We police your typos. We prefer po-po to police though. Send us donuts.
