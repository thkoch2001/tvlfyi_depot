      "message": "Overall, I\u0027m confused. I have trouble understanding what this thing is doing on top of `asyncwriteext::write_all`.\n\nLooking at the documentation:\n\n\u003e         /// Attempts to write an entire buffer into this writer.\n        ///\n        /// Equivalent to:\n        ///\n        /// ```ignore\n        /// async fn write_all(\u0026mut self, buf: \u0026[u8]) -\u003e io::Result\u003c()\u003e;\n        /// ```\n        ///\n        /// This method will continuously call [`write`] until there is no more data\n        /// to be written. This method will not return until the entire buffer\n        /// has been successfully written or such an error occurs. The first\n        /// error generated from this method will be returned.\n        /// # Errors\n        ///\n        /// This function will return the first error that [`write`] returns.\n\nLooks pretty in line with what you implemented.\n\nI\u0027m probably missing the obvious, meaning we should probably explicitly document why is this thing needed and why the bare `write_all`-based `write_bytes` function is not good enough.",
