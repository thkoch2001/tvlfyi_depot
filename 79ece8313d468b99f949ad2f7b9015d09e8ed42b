Because the store object above is *input* addressed.  `lf8ghiy89rfhqqyh9j98270afwjqzyrb` is actually the hash of the *input* to the process that built `boost`; it isn\u0027t a hash of any part of the build output.\n\nThis can also be used to request pathinfo for a `.drv` file by its own drv-hash, which is the hash of the derivation (not the hash of its outputs).  In other words, you could use this to get path information for\n\n```\n  /nix/store/4zwkgb6cg46j3n8nzpnqw4s6x33ynmi5-boost-1.79.0.drv\n```\n\nusing `GetPathInfoRequest(by_what.by_output_hash\u003dbase32_decode(\"4zwkgb6cg46j3n8nzpnqw4s6x33ynmi5\"))`, I think.\n\nFinally, if/when we support content-addressible derivations, this method will let you request path info by the output address *of a content-addressible derivation*.\n\nSo there are really three cases here, but the implementation logic is the same for all of them:\n\n1. Look up an ordinary derivation output by its input-address\n2. Look up a derivation by its content-address (the hash of the derivation itself)\n3. (Someday) look up a CA-derivation output by its output-address\n\nThe logic for all three cases is the same: just look up the path by its address.  Sometimes that\u0027s the output address, sometimes it\u0027s the input address.\n\nOr maybe I\u0027ve just totally misunderstood what this does.\n\nI probably wrote way too much here.",
