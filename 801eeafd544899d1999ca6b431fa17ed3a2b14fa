      "message": "Currently in these test cases there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything that requires evaluation, but I agree - eqValues is the \"correct\" way to compare nix::Value.\n\nFWIW this complicates things quite a bit: Evaluation needs a store to exist etc. etc. - the DummyStore class can be used in tests, but doesn\u0027t fully support the store interface yet so some evaluations fail.",
