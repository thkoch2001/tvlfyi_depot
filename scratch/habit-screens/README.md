# Habit Screens

Problem: I would like to increase the rate at which I complete my daily, weekly,
monthly, yearly habits.

Solution: Habit Screens are mounted in strategic locations throughout my
apartment. Each Habit Screen displays the habits that I should complete that
day, and I can tap each item to mark it as complete. I will encounter the Habit
Screens in my bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, so I will have adequate "cues" to
focus my attention. By marking each item as complete and tracking the results
over time, I will have more incentive to maintain my consistency
(i.e. "reward").
