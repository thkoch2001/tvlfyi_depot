      "message": "Why do we need to wait for blob uploads of any children to have happened before sending out the Directory referring to it?\n\nDirectoryService usually doesn\u0027t have a reference to BlobService, so they don\u0027t do any checking of the blobs to exist. I think the code will be a bit simpler if we don\u0027t wait for the blobs to be uploaded first here.\n\nIf we (evezr) add some validation in DirectoryServices at a later point, it could happen in the final closing of the stream (and we surely did upload all blobs then)",
