      "message": "In real-life, the generators would produce instructions to the VM. They can:\n\n1. Request thunk forcing (many cases).\n2. Request function application (e.g. `__toString` in coerce_to_string).\n\nI\u0027m not yet sure how the communication *back* would work. Currently everywhere this happens has a `\u0026mut VM`, but I suspect that this will no longer work with borrowing rules. I\u0027ll try integrating this in cl/8104 for something simple (e.g. coerce_to_string, or nix_eq, or something like that) and discover what the interaction actually looks like.",
