      "message": "This would probably be easier understandable if squashed with the previous commit, as it mostly changes everything introduced here.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m still inclined to say that below TVL_LINKS code should live in tools/cheddar/src/bin/cheddar.rs, not the library.\n\nShameless selfishness, but I\u0027d like to use cheddar as a library, outside TVL context.\n\nOnce there\u0027s other entrypoints into cheddar library code (and they are in TVL context), we could think about sharing these regexes across these entrypoints, but I\u0027d really prefer if lib.rs could be somewhat agnostic.",
