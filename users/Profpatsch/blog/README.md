# (Parts of) my website

This is a part of https://profpatsch.de/, notably the blog posts.

The other parts can be found in [vuizvui](https://github.com/openlab-aux/vuizvui/tree/master/pkgs/profpatsch/profpatsch.de). It’s a mess.

And yes, this implements a webserver & routing engine with nix, execline & s6 utils. “Bis einer weint”, as we say in German.
