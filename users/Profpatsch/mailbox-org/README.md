# mailbox-org

Interfacing with the API of [https://mailbox.org/]().

They use [open-xchange](https://www.open-xchange.com/resources/oxpedia) as their App Suite, so we have to work with/reverse engineer their weird API.

Intended so I have a way of uploading Sieve rules into their system semi-automatically.
