 * @brief Simple library for constructing XML documents
 *
 * This library provides a C interface for opening and closing
 * XML tags as well as filling them with content. It is mainly
 * intended for constructing XML/HTML documents by directly
 * writing them to a `FILE *`.
 *
 * It's main advantage over plain `printf()` is that it keeps
 * track of open tags, enabling it to automatically close
 * open tags (saving a few lines of code) using `xml_close_all()`
 * and `xml_close_including()` and/or to detect errors in the
 * programmer's XML nesting. For information on its sanity
 * checking abilities see the documentation of `xml_close_tag()`.
 *
 * Currently it has some limitations (possibly incomplete list):
 *
 * * It does not give the calling code feedback if errors occurred
 * * It doesn't do validity checking of tags
 * * It can't generate pretty output (i. e. properly indented),
 *   its output is currently always "minified".
 *
 * Extra care should be taken when handling untrusted data. This
 * library is mainly designed and tested with generating XML/HTML
 * output from trusted data in mind.

/*!
 * @brief Close a previously opened tag.
 *
 * `xml_close_tag()` first checks the head of the current `xml_stack`
 * if the provided `tag` is in fact the current innermost opened tag.
 *
 * If this is true, it outputs the closing tag, removes the reference
 * to the tag on top of the `xml_stack` and frees this part of the
 * structure.
 *
 * If it isn't true, it does nothing and outputs an appropriate warning
 * to `ctx->warn` if it is not `NULL`:
 *
 * * `Refusing to close tag xyz, unclosed tags remaining`
 * * `Refusing to close tag zyx, no tags left to be closed`
 *
 * This sanity checking of tag closing ensures that a xml document
 * constructed by this module has no nesting errors, i. e. every tag
 * is closed at the proper nesting level. Because it is only simple
 * runtime checking in specific calls it can't prevent / detect the
 * following errors:
 *
 * * It can't prevent unclosed tags remaining at the end. You can
 *   however prevent this by calling `xml_close_all()` at the end of
 *   your XML outputting code.
 * * It can worsen a situation with remaining unclosed tags: If
 *   an inner tag is left unclosed, it will refuse to close all
 *   outer tags, leaving a trail of unclosed tags behind.
 * * It will always attribute the error to closing: Some errors
 *   will be caused by missing an `xml_open_tag()` somewhere, but
 *   `xml_close_tag()` will think the closing is erroneous. Of course
 *   it's also unable to resolve the error.
 * * It can't compare against the intended XML structure: Sometimes
 *   a programming error will result in an "wrong" XML structure
 *   which is still completely valid to `xml_close_tag()`, i. e.
 *   correctly nested.
 *
 * Overall the sanity checking is limited, as you can see, but
 * it should generate *some* warning if a detectable issue is
 * present (invalid XML nesting) and never actively output
 * a tag that makes the XML nesting invalid.
 *
 * These properties should however be enough to detect issues
 * quickly in development. Additionally the sanity checking is
 * cheap enough to be feasible in production. `xml_close_tag()`
 * only needs to call `strcmp` once per invocation.

/*!

 *
 * Internally it's an alias for `xml_close_all(ctx, NULL)`

/*!
 * @brief Close all unclosed tags until a given one.
 *
 * `xml_close_including()` works like `xml_close_all()`, but

 * If the given tag is not present in the stack, it behaves
 * like `xml_close_all()`. It is not possible to match
 * a `CDATA` section using `xml_close_including()`.
 *
 * Be aware that it might lead to unexpected results if
 * multiple tags of the same are nested. Consider the
 * following snippet.
 *
 * ```c
 * xml_open_tag(&ctx, "a");
 * xml_open_tag(&ctx, "b");
 * xml_close_tag(&ctx, "a");
 * xml_open_tag(&ctx, "c");
 * xml_raw(&ctx, "value");
 * xml_close_including(&ctx, "a");
 * ```
 *
 * `xml_close_including()` will stop as soon as it hits the first
 * tag "a", although it might be intended to keep going until the
 * outermost one. The result would be:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <a><b><a><c>value</c></a>
 * ```
 *
 * This is the behavior of `xml_close_including()`: It closes all
 * unclosed tags until it hits the first instance of the specified
 * tag which is also closed.
 *
 * This function will also limit error detection like `xml_close_all()`.
 * For an explanation of this, see its documentation.
