      .Sh DESCRIPTION
      For those of us who travel often or coordinate across many timezones,
      working with local time is frequently impractical.
      ISO8601, in all its wisdom, allows for time zone designators,
      but still represents the hours and minutes as local time,
      thus making it inconvenient for quickly comparing timestamps from
      different locations.
      .Pp
      Dot time instead uses UTC for all date, hour, and minute indications,
      and while it allows for time zone designators, they are optional
      information that can be dropped without changing the indicated time.
      It uses an alternate hour separator to make it easy to distinguish from
      regular ISO8601.
      When a time zone designator is provided, one can easily obtain
      the matching local time by adding the UTC offset to the UTC time.
      .Sh EXAMPLES
      These timestamps all represent the same point in time.
