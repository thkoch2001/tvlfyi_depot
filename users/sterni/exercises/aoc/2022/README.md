# sterni's [Advent of Code 2022](adventofcode.com/2022)

I'm trying to do it in BQN again to redeem myself for my unfinished [AoC 2021](../2021),
but will allow myself falling back to another language if I get stuck, so I actually
complete this one.
~~I also plan to write additional solutions in Nix (when I have the time) in order to
throw `//tvix/eval` against some new problems.~~
We'll see how it goes, as my December promises to be quite busy.
