This is an interpreter for the Lox language, based on the book "[Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)".

The book's original code uses Java, but I don't want to use Java, so I've
decided to take on the extra complexity of porting it to Rust.

Note: This implements the first of two Lox interpreters.
