generator-example
=================

This is an experiment with the [`genawaiter`][] crate, to see if it
could be suitable for dealing with the execution flattening problem in
Tvix.

It constructs a dummy example that is similar to some of the problems
we have in Tvix that require generator-like thunk forcing.
