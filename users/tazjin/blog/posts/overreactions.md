"It Will Look Like We Overreacted"
==================================

If you paid any attention to world events in March, you will most
likely have herd the phrase "flatten the curve".

To recap briefly, the idea behind that was to slow the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 via various measures to prevent healthcare systems from
being overloaded. At the time it was believed that COVID-19, the
disease caused by the virus, had a catastrophic infection fatality
rate[^1][^2] and that mechanical ventilation (which are in limited
supply) would be a crucial part of the treatment[^3].

This strategy was rolled out unevenly and with each country choosing
its own methodology initially, but eventually the vast majority of
Western countries converged on "lockdowns" of varying severity levels.

It was during the introduction of these measures that a sentiment,
stated once by Anthony Fauci as "I think we should be overly
aggressive and get criticized for overreacting", started circulating.

With the knowledge we had at the time this was reasonable: We were
facing a potentially *very* lethal pandemic and assumed that most of
the population was susceptible[^4] to the disease. It was best to
exercise caution until we improved our understanding of the situation,
and then to adapt our response as necessary.

What happened instead is that a lot of people got involved, and did as
humans do. The media started exclusively reporting negative news about
the disease, Boris Johnson's Conservatives introduced harsh lockdown
measures later than other countries, Trump embraced unproven
medication and scary numbers lacking context started ticking up
quickly.

The result was an unprecedented level of tribalisation, as everyone
realised they needed to hold precisely the opposite opinion of whoever
they wanted to be seen as opposing. Preventative reactions became a
political contest and [spun out of
control](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maq.12599).

In the meantime the virus continued its uncaring, [geographically
uneven](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EfuKG1xWsAYmNb_?format=jpg)[^5]
rollout across the globe and we learned that the links between
epidemic progression and the most favoured countermeasures are less
clear[^6] than initially assumed.

We are now half a year into this situation and it's become absurd.
California has simultaneously ordered people to shelter-in-place, and
evacuate their homes. The politician responsible for the largest
COVID19-related mortality spike *in the world* is publishing a book
about his leadership skills[^7] in this crisis. That darn phrase, "it
will look like we overreacted", is being applied to justify policies
it never covered in the first place.

To break out of this, everyone urgently needs to re-evaluate what they
think they know about the pandemic. If we don't do that we may just
end up causing more damage than we ever faced from this in the first
place.

    and medical professionals quickly adapted.

    rather quickly, as patterns emerged which pointed towards some
    level of pre-existing immunity in populations. Data around this is
    still emerging, and some preliminary findings indicate that there
    may be cross-immunity with other human coronaviruses as some of
    those responsible for the common cold.

    didn't. The only measures that seem to reliably have made a
    difference are related to care homes (e.g. saving lives in Germany
    by preventing spread into care homes, or causing the highest
    relative death tolls in the world in New York & Italy by doing the
    opposite).
