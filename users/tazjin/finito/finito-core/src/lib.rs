//! Finito's core finite-state machine abstraction.
//!
//! # What & why?
//!
//! Most processes that occur in software applications can be modeled
//! as finite-state machines (FSMs), however the actual states, the
//! transitions between them and the model's interaction with the
//! external world is often implicit.
//!
//! Making the states of a process explicit using a simple language
//! that works for both software developers and other people who may
//! have opinions on processes makes it easier to synchronise thoughts,
//! extend software and keep a good level of control over what is going
//! on.
//!
//! This library aims to provide functionality for implementing
//! finite-state machines in a way that balances expressivity and
//! safety.
//!
//! Finito does not aim to prevent every possible incorrect
//! transition, but aims for somewhere "safe-enough" (please don't
//! lynch me) that is still easily understood.
//!
//! # Conceptual overview
//!
//! The core idea behind Finito can be expressed in a single line and
//! will potentially look familiar if you have used Erlang in a
//! previous life. The syntax used here is the type-signature notation
//! of Haskell.
//!
//! ```text
//! advance :: state -> event -> (state, [action])
//! ```
//!
//! In short, every FSM is made up of three distinct types:
//!
//!   * a state type representing all possible states of the machine
//!
//!   * an event type representing all possible events in the machine
//!
//!   * an action type representing a description of all possible side-effects of the machine
//!
//! Using the definition above we can now say that a transition in a
//! state-machine, involving these three types, takes an initial state
//! and an event to apply it to and returns a new state and a list of
//! actions to execute.
//!
//! With this definition most processes can already be modeled quite
//! well. Two additional functions are required to make it all work:
//!
//! ```text
//! -- | The ability to cause additional side-effects after entering
//! -- a new state.
//! > enter :: state -> [action]
//! ```
//!
//! as well as
//!
//! ```text
//! -- | An interpreter for side-effects
//! act :: action -> m [event]
//! ```
//!
//! **Note**: This library is based on an original Haskell library. In
//! Haskell, side-effects can be controlled via the type system which
//! is impossible in Rust.
//!
//! Some parts of Finito make assumptions about the programmer not
//! making certain kinds of mistakes, which are pointed out in the
//! documentation. Unfortunately those assumptions are not
//! automatically verifiable in Rust.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Please consult `finito-door` for an example representing a simple,
//! lockable door as a finite-state machine. This gives an overview
//! over Finito's primary features.
//!
//! If you happen to be the kind of person who likes to learn about
//! libraries by reading code, you should familiarise yourself with the
//! door as it shows up as the example in other finito-related
//! libraries, too.
//!
//! # Persistence, side-effects and mud
//!
//! These three things are inescapable in the fateful realm of
//! computers, but Finito separates them out into separate libraries
//! that you can drag in as you need them.
//!
//! Currently, those libraries include:
//!
//!   * `finito`: Core components and classes of Finito
//!
//!   * `finito-in-mem`: In-memory implementation of state machines that do not need to live longer
//!     than an application using standard library concurrency primitives.
//!
//!   * `finito-postgres`: Postgres-backed, persistent implementation of state machines that, well,
//!     do need to live longer. Uses Postgres for concurrency synchronisation, so keep that in mind.
//!
//! Which should cover most use-cases. Okay, enough prose, lets dive
//! in.
//!
//! # Does Finito make you want to scream?
//!
//! Please reach out! I want to know why!
