Kinesis configuration
=====================

This folder backs up the configuration for my Kinesis keyboards.
Configuration is not mutually compatible between the Advantage 2 and
the Advantage 360, so they are stored in different folders and
(mostly) programmed on-board.

I keep these around in case I get a new keyboard and want to bootstrap
it to behave the same way as the previous one.
