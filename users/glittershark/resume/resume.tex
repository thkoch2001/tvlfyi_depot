\section{Skills}
\cvitem{Clojure}{Extensive experience architecting, deploying, and building
complex web applications in Clojure and Clojurescript, with a focus on
Re-Frame and Reagent.}
\cvitem{Haskell}{Passionate love for pure functional programming as a hobbyist
pursuit, but also practical experience building production systems in Haskell at
scale, and using Haskell's advanced type system extensions where appropriate to
deliver increased ergonomics and safety.}
\cvitem{Nix}{Experience with adopting and teaching nix at scale in a production
stack both for local development dependencies and for configuring and building
production software. Core contributer to a fork of the nix implementation itself
(tvix) aimed at providing increased safety, performance, and flexibility.}
\cvitem{Scala}{Understanding of Scala from the perspective of a functional
programmer rather than a Java programmer. Experience building production
big-data processing systems using Akka, and deep programming with Scala's type
system using Shapeless.}
\cvitem{Unix/Linux}{Experience with administrating highly available distributed
systems. Passion for the Unix philosophy of discrete, composable units of
functionality.}
\cvitem{Ruby}{Experience building both full-stack applications with Ruby on
Rails in addition to smaller microservices and custom frameworks. Deep
understanding of the internals of the Ruby interpreter and object system.}
\cvitem{Javascript}{Experience developing real-time responsive single-page web
applications using React, in addition to significant contributions to the React
open-source community.}
\cvitem{SQL}{Deep understanding of relational databases, including experience
designing the database schema in Postgres for an application with over a decade
of usage, hundreds of gigabytes of data, complex, multi-tiered hierarchical data
structures, as well as experience writing and optimizing large, complex queries
against that database.}
