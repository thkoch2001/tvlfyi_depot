# In total this should take one hour to complete. This is a substantial amount
# of time, which may disincentivize me from completing it. This time is
# amortized over the length of its usefulness (i.e. an entire month), so it
# should be thought of instead as two-minutes worth of work per day that is all
# being completed upfront.
