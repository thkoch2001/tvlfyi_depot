# Scratch

The purpose of the `scratch` directory is to host practice exercises. Practice
encompasses things like working on data structures and algorithms problems for
upcoming coding interviews or general aptitude as well as writing code snippets
to help me learn a new programming language or understand an unfamiliar concept.
