# Common Lisp

Things that I like about Common Lisp:
- It's an S-expression based language.
- It has a powerful macro system
- It has a unique way of handling-errors
- It is highly introspectible
- The tooling integration with Emacs is the best I have ever seen for any language

Things that I don't like about Common Lisp:
- I find its standard libraries difficult to use and -- compared to modern
  libraries -- like Golang's or Elixir's standard libraries, Common Lisp's
  libraries are clunky

As such, I would like to modernize CL's libraries to resemble other libraries
with which I am more familiar and, therefore, productive.
