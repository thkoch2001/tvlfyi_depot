# Snippets

Specifying snippets that I plan on defining for most of the programming
languages with which I work. I hope this will serve as a checklist of language
constructs I should support when adopting a new language.

## Shared language features

These are language features that should be available across most of the
languages that I'm hoping to support.

- `ld`: anonymous functions (i.e. lambdas)
- `fn`: named function definition
- `var`: variable definition

## Miscellaneous other language KBDs

Some of this is related to language tool must-haves, which may need to be a
separate document.

- `<leader>d`: Show documentation
- `<leader>x`: Evaluate expression (works mostly for LISPs)
