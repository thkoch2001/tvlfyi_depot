# Emacs

Emacs is one of a handful software projects that I highly value. I consider it
as central to my workflow as `git` and `nix`.

## Installing

If you already have `depot` on your local file system, run the following from
the top-level `depot` directory:

```shell
$ nix-env -iA users.wpcarro.emacs.nixos
```

Test edit (from depot).
