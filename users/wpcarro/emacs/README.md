# Emacs

Emacs is one of a handful software projects that I highly value. I consider it
as central to my workflow as `git` and `nix`.

## Installing

If you already have `briefcase` on your local file system, run the following
from the top-level `briefcase` directory:

```shell
$ nix-build -f . -iA emacs.nixos
```
