# Github Issues Service (GIS)

You have a website and your users want to request features or report bugs. How
do they do this?

Our robot, GIS, can help you. GIS adds a widget to your website that allows
users to easily request features and report bugs.

## Getting Started

If Github is hosting your website's source code, you're ready to start using
GIS. GIS works with public and private repositories.

Let's adopt Github's notion of "issues" to group feature requests and bug
reports together. When users click the GIS widget to create an issue, GIS
displays a modal form that the user completes. When the user submits the form,
GIS creates an issue on your Github repository. Now your team can use all of
Github's rich issue-tracking tools to manage your issues.

## Installation

To add GIS to your website, register your Github repository with us and we'll
give you a snippet to add to your website's HTML. It's that simple.
