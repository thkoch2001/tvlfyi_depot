\section{Skills}
\cvitem{Rust}{Expertise in high-performance, low latency, low-level systems
development with Rust, including everything from fundamental data structure
implementation to asynchronous distributed systems development}
\cvitem{Clojure}{Extensive experience architecting, deploying, and building
complex web applications in Clojure and Clojurescript, with a focus on
Re-Frame and Reagent. Experience testing distributed systems in Clojure using
Jepsen.}
\cvitem{Haskell}{Passionate love for pure functional programming as a hobbyist
pursuit, but also practical experience building production systems in Haskell at
scale, and using Haskell's advanced type system extensions where appropriate to
deliver increased ergonomics and safety.}
\cvitem{Nix}{Experience with adopting and teaching nix at scale in a production
stack both for local development dependencies and for configuring and building
production software. Core contributer to a fork of the nix implementation itself
(tvix) aimed at providing increased safety, performance, and flexibility.}
\cvitem{Unix/Linux}{Experience with administrating highly available distributed
systems. Passion for the Unix philosophy of discrete, composable units of
functionality.}
\cvitem{Ruby}{Experience building both full-stack applications with Ruby on
Rails in addition to smaller microservices and custom frameworks. Deep
understanding of the internals of the Ruby interpreter and object system.}
\cvitem{Javascript}{Experience developing real-time responsive single-page web
applications using React, in addition to significant contributions to the React
open-source community.}
\cvitem{SQL}{Deep understanding of relational databases as both a user -- in the
context of large-scale web-applications with terabytes of data -- and an
implementer, in the context of an innovative new database implementing a query
planner and incremental materialization for the PostgreSQL and MySQL dialects of
SQL from the ground up}

\section{Experience}
\subsection{Employment}
\cventry{2020--2023}{Staff Software Engineer}{ReadySet}{Remote}{}
{Founding engineer at a startup bringing a high performance
  partially-stateful, incrementally-maintained SQL database based on the Noria
  thesis to market
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Served as the main technical leadership for the project throughout its
          maturation from a research codebase to a production-grade system
    \item Took the project from a research prototype to a production ready
          system.
    \item Incorporated the Noria thesis with multiple research papers,
          masters theses, and other papers from database research, in addition to
          original database research and development.
    \item Invented or helped develop multiple novel database techniques in
          partially materialized dataflow, including index planning and
          selection, pagination, post-lookup aggregate processing, partial
          ``straddled'' joins, weak indexes for correct execution of partial
          joins, and more.
    \item Invented novel ways to test SQL databases, including a new deterministic
          generator for SQL queries.
    \item Developed the clustered high availability distributed runtime mode from
          a buggy research project into a production ready distributed system
          that passed a suite of Jepsen tests.
    \item Implemented a significant fraction of the SQL query planner, which
          required both implementing algorithms specified in database research
          papers and inventing new techniques to work around the limitations of
          partially materialized dataflow
    \item Optimized critical components of the code base, including algorithmic
          optimizations, CPU cache analysis, low-level data structures, and
          broad system runtime analysis
    \item Implemented a type inference engine and expression evaluator that
          supported multiple dialects of SQL configured at compile-time, with
          maximum code reuse while preserving maintainability
    \item Mentored multiple junior and senior engineers
    \item Open-Source contributions visible at
          \url{https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/commits?author=glittershark}
