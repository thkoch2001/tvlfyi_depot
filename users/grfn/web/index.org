my name is aspen smith and i'm a software engineer and musician.

* code

- [[https://github.com/glittershark/][github]]
- [[https://cs.tvl.fyi/depot/-/tree/users/grfn][my directory in the tvl monorepo]]

* work

i am currently looking for a job! ideally i'd like to do something involving
compilers or database query planners, or other low-level systems work. i'm
pretty language-agnostic generally, but i'm quite fond of rust and prefer not to
work in go. if you're interested, send me an [[mailto:web@gws.fyi][email]].

most recently, i worked on database internals at [[https://readyset.io/][readyset]], an incrementally
maintained, partially stateful materialized view maintenance system for sql
that's wire-compatible with postgresql and mysql, based on [[https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria][noria]].

* projects

- [[https://windtunnel.ci/][windtunnel]], a continuous benchmarking software-as-a-service currently accepting early alpha users (send me an email if you want to try it out!)
- [[https://cs.tvl.fyi/depot/-/tree/users/grfn/achilles][achilles]], a compiler for (what I plan to become) a dependently typed, low-level functional programming language targeting LLVM
- [[https://github.com/glittershark/org-clubhouse][org-clubhouse]], an emacs package for lightweight integration between [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] and [[https://clubhouse.io/][the clubhouse project management tool]]
- [[https://cs.tvl.fyi/depot/-/tree/users/grfn/xanthous][xanthous]], a terminal roguelike in haskell that I work on intermittently and exclusively for fun \\
  you can now try xanthous out over ssh by running ~ssh -p 2222 xanthous.gws.fyi~. if you do so I'd love if you send me an email about it

* music

- https://sacrosanct.bandcamp.com/, a post-rock project with a [[https://bandcamp.com/h34rken][friend of mine]]
- [[https://soundcloud.com/missingggg][my current soundcloud]], releasing instrumental hip-hop under the name *missing*
