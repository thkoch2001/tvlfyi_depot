      "message": "I think something similar already landed. In canon, iter_context() also returns an iterator over context elements, the context elements are in a HashSet, and iter_context() just does piggy-back on on that (and its iterator). The specific iter_{plain,derivation,single_outputs} specific iterators use iter_context() and then a flatmap. Contrary to this CL, the \"empty context\" part is signalled by an empty HashSet, so some logic could be dropped.\n\nI think this CL can be abandoned.",
