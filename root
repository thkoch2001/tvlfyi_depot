This will get owned by people in nasty ways.\n\nTo work around this, we can mangle some nginx configuration to try and drop the requests that edit settings. The requests go via GraphQL and can only be distinguished from the ones we want to allow based on query parameters, which is a bit unfortunate.\n\nWe'll have to see how bad it gets and figure something out.","files":null}]}
