An alternative way of doing this is making the result field a oneof of a success/error message, I\u0027ll try that and put it in here.\n\nI\u0027d prefer not extracting very simple messages to avoid making the proto structure too complicated - IMO, if there is another structure somewhere that also has `output` and `drv_hash` that\u0027s fine.",
