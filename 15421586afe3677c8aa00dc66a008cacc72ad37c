      "message": "Again, should probably be moved into a separate file.\n\nLooking at the gdoc history, there was a\n\n```\n  /// Error that occured during a build. This does not close the stream.\n  /// If the error is so severe the coordinator wants to kill the evaluation,\n  /// it can simply close the stream.\n  BuildError(BuildError),\n\n```\n\nThis BuildError was to notify the evaluator that an error has occured while it built something requested with BuildRequest (but allowing the evaluator to keep evaluating) - independent of whether it already started streaming it or not.\n\nWe currently somewhat miss this possibility.",
