      "message": "I think we should also make configurable which builtins are available, to allow passing in other builtins without having to edit this file.\n\nFor example, we might:\n - want to only make available non-IO builtins\n - redefine builtins.currentSystem to something else\n - run an evaluation with different flavors of builtins.derivation\n\nCurrently, these are all defined in `pub fn global_builtins`, and we use feature flags to comment out some of the code defining some of the builtins, but this could potentially be a runtime thing.",
