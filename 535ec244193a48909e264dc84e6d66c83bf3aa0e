      "message": "Thanks \u0026 welcome!\n\nMy first thought is that we should probably put this in a submodule of builtins instead, as it doesn\u0027t seem to (unless I missed something?) need internal APIs of the `NixString` type.\n\nAre there more builtins that will need this? In that case we may want to introduce `builtins::versions` and move it there, otherwise I think having a `builtins::compare_versions` (i.e. specifically for this function) is also ok.",

The harder part is finding a good place.\n\nThese are the places it is used in nix (might not be exhaustive)\nbuiltins.compareVersions\nbuiltins.splitVersion\nnix-env -u\n\nI don\u0027t know what your plans are for the tvix-cli. If implementing that is far far away builtins::versions would be a good place for now in my opinion.",
