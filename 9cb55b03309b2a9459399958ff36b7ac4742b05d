      "message": "Initially I wanted to keep this pub(crate) and simply add another method to TvixStoreIO that uses KnownPaths::get_derivation and just returns the result of get_derivations, but that\u0027s not possible because you cannot return borrowed data from a RefCell. So I had to make this public and run the inner get_derivations from tvix-cli. I\u0027m not too worried about making known_paths public in TvixStoreIO as KnownPaths itself is already public and has public methods (though the struct fields are still private). Let me know what y\u0027all think.",
