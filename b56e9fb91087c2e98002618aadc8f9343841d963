      "message": "Yes, it affects `.outPath` hashes of packages downstream of the affected FOD.\n\nBasically, try this CL, and if it panics you know that the code *before* this CL would have returned an incorrect value instead.  Of course the best solution would be to fix the bug, but in the meantime I think that panicing at the point of error is better than silently returning incorrect results.\n\nTo fix the underlying bug we will need to change the data structures: `path` can\u0027t be just a `HashMap\u003cPathName, PathKind\u003e`; the values of the `HashMap` will somehow need to be a collection of `PathKind`s.\n\n\u003e Also note that things like https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/4347 exist,\n\nYou mentioned that PR on IRC, but I think you misunderstand what it does.  Read the code that goes with it -- notice how all of the important changes are wrapped in \"if `ca-derivations` then\" blocks.  The PR comment doesn\u0027t explain this, so it\u0027s easy to misread what it does unless you look at the code.\n\nAnyways, that PR has absolutely no effect unless you\u0027re using `ca-derivations`, which tvix doesn\u0027t support yet.",

For output path calculation, FODs are replaced with some hashDevivationModulo string (https://cs.tvl.fyi/depot@6c586bc2a7a49755b4b2566c034bc1affc92011d/-/blob/tvix/nix-compat/src/derivation/mod.rs?L151), so this should only differ if the name differs (and we do already consider this different with the current design?)\n\n\u003e You mentioned that PR on IRC, but I think you misunderstand what it does.

My point was mostly that even Nix started to short-circuit in some FODs, because the output path doesn\u0027t change.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s better to talk about this in sync, to make sure we both talk about the same thing?",
