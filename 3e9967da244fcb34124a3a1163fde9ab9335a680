      "message": "That\u0027s not what I meant with my question - Assume a client uses `BlobService::open_write()`, then halfway stops writing (because the process dies, or couldn\u0027t get all the data it wanted to write, …), doesn\u0027t matter - it does not call `close()`.\n\nIn that case we don\u0027t want the blob to be finalized, aka nothing should be written in `blobs/…` (EOF code handling of `upload_blob`), only some stray `chunks/…` might be stay sitting around.\n\nDoes the code behave like this currently, or does `upload_blob` see a EOF in these cases too? If that\u0027s the case, we might need to signal differently that the upload should be aborted…",
