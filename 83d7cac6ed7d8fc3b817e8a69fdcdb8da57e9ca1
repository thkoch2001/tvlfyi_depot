I think that probably wastes quite a bit of resources, because we can\u0027t even reuse the previous build results if the content of some input file changes.\n\nProblem: the proposal would have a significant downside, because the tests would no longer run,\nand some solution where we swap the order when compiling in CI vs local also doesn\u0027t sound good.",
