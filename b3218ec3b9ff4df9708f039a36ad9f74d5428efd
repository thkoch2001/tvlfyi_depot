      "message": "Could we wrap the GC stuff with a `#[cfg(tvix_gc)]`?\n\nI know that\u0027s going to get noisy, but:\n\n1. I think there will always be situations where it\u0027s just faster to not GC.  If you have lots of memory then anything less than all-of-nixos will run faster without any GC at all.\n\n2. GC bugs are pretty damn nightmarish.  Being able to compile-out the GC in order to quickly determine whether or not it is causing a bug is really valuable.\n\n3. It sounds like we need a GC fairly urgently, but we\u0027re not 100% sure if this crate is the right one to use.  If we keep the current choice separated by a `#[cfg]` it\u0027s easier to change that decision later on (or even have two alternative GC implementations for a brief period of time).\n\nAnyways this LGTM if we put a `#[cfg(tvix_gc)]` around it.",
