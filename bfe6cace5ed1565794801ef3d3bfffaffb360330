I think it might even be inevitable, unless Rust adds explicit tailcalls (which is not happening anytime soon).",

      "message": "This is quite an understatement ðŸ˜Š at least as applied to the state of the code where I handed it off (I have not yet caught up on what\u0027s happened since then).\n\nI basically made a big buggy mess out of the VM loop in my trampoline CL, and the fact that it was a big buggy mess was the main reason why it hadn\u0027t reached the \"ready to review\" stage at that point.  I admit that I did not fully understand the changes I was making there.",
