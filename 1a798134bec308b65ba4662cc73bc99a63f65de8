What about the `r:` prefix depending on outputHashMode? Should it apply in these cases too?\n\nLooking at cl/7756, we unconditionally seem to be running this on all derivations - if that\u0027s the case, maybe add an explaining comment to the top?\n\nAnother idea would be to do the VM forcing outside of populate_output_configuration, and then blend this and cl/7933 back together.\n\nThis would also allow us to get rid of the fake VM.",
