It\u0027s got a bit of spooky-action-at-a-distance feeling, which isn\u0027t necessarily bad but it feels a bit too early to add stuff like that (before *we* even really understand everything, as it\u0027s possible that we\u0027ll add things like multithreading to the VM later which might have an impact on this).",
