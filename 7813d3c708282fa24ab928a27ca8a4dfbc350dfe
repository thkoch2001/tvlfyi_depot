      "message": "This is a bit awkward. The `directory_putter` errors out if you call close on it without having put any directories. In the case of ingesting a single file or symlink we won\u0027t have put any dirs, so we don\u0027t close in that case.\n\nThe close also returns the digest of the last directory that was put, but we don\u0027t rely on that here.\n\nWithout having too much context, maybe the putter shouldn\u0027t return a digest and closing a putter without having put anything is not an error. Then we rely on the caller to keep track of digests and the root node like we already do here.",
