I think it would be worthwhile to actually support generating some kind of \u003cdepot\u003e channel by creating a tarball after a successful canon build.\n\nUsing channels we would get auto update functionality for free and also would get the guarantee that CI is green instead of effectively verifying that the system builds by trying to build it periodically downstream.",
