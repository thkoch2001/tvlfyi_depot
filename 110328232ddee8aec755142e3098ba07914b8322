      "message": "That\u0027s the idea of b/296. My honest take is we have to limit how much blockage we accept from `//users`, especially during times of relatively low activity.\n\nOf course sterni and I usually do simple fixes when bumping channels, but with something as complex as this migration (which has been on the horizon for a long time) we need to move forward at some point.\n\nIn many other monorepo setups the solution is instead to not require a \"green trunk\", but I\u0027m not a fan of that. This new mechanism can also be extended to actually do an inverse assertion (i.e. *assert* that the build fails, fail the build if it unexpectedly succeeds) so that we don\u0027t forget to re-enable stuff.",
