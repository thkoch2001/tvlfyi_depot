      "message": "asyncUploadThreshold already causes a per-task memory limit, we could probably just have a variable for the maximum number of tasks, and `asyncBlobWg.SetLimit(N)` initially to prevent more than N+1 times that threshold of buffered blob contents in memory.\nIn practice, it\u0027s probably a bit lower, as not all blobs in a NAR are just right before that threshold.\n\nThis would remove the need for the semaphore tracking, and prevent someone sending a nar with very very small blobs to cause a lot of requests to the blobservice at the same time (as they don\u0027t fill up the semaphore).",
