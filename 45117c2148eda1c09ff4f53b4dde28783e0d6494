      "message": "Originally when I wrote this logic I wanted it so that it could be unambiguous without `--` as long as a target is given (or the empty target `\"\"`).\n\nMaybe this way is better (always requiring `--`), since it also allows us adding a `-b` flag to choose the executable to run in case of multiple ones and it probably also makes it easier to allow passing Nix flags somehow (probably after a second `--`).\n\nI say: let\u0027s do it if tazjin agrees. Feel free to resolve.",
