      "message": "Websites like http://cedric.dufour.name/blah/IT/SmartCardsHowto.html say one should use onepin-…, as otherwise things like the SSH agent try to unlock both tokens/slots:\n\n\u003e One MUST use OpenSC’s onepin-opensc-pkcs11.so library to prevent the SSH agent from attempting to unlock all tokens/slots with the same PIN and eventually locking those tokens/slots that do not match. This is also the reason why one MUST create the login token/slot as the first one on the smart card.\n\nWhat\u0027s the state of this? Is this still an issue?",

      "message": "This guide points to the `onepin-opensc-pkcs11.so` module directly, not the `p11-pkit-proxy.so` one used here, so that should not be a problem (I don\u0027t see why one would use the proxy for SSH).\n\nEither way, there\u0027s a link[0] above the text you quoted which links to Fedora\u0027s OpenSSH patch[1] which documents that it was merged into OpenSSH 8.6p1[2] (released on 2021-04-19).\n\n0: https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-28-better-smart-card-support-openssh/\n1: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d2474\n2: https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.6\n\nSo this does not seem to be an issue any longer.",
