      "message": "\"readtree\" is kind of an internal name, not a user-facing name. If somebody was dealing with a readTree-based repo for the first time, and saw a bunch of \"readtree.nix\" files, it wouldn\u0027t explain very much.\n\nI still have a goal of moving Nix closer to Bazel in terms of how the interface looks. Maybe `build.nix` (analogous to Bazel\u0027s BUILD files) would be a better name?\n\nEvgeny, do you have thoughts on this?",
