#+TITLE: Converse

Welcome to Converse, a work-in-progress forum software written in
Rust. The intention behind Converse is to provide a simple forum-like
experience.

There is not a lot of documentation about Converse yet and it has
several known issues. Also note that Converse is being developed for a
specific use-case and is not going to be a forum feature kitchen-sink
like most classical forum softwares.

Better documentation is forthcoming once the remaining basics have
been taken care of.
