We've now been working on our rewrite of Nix, [Tvix][], for a little more than
two years.

Our last written update was in September 2023, and although we did publish a
couple of things in the meantime (flokli's talk on Tvix at [NixCon
2023][nixcon2023], our interview at the [Nix Developer
Dialogues][nix-dev-dialogues-tvix], or tazjin's [talk on
tvix-eval][tvix-eval-ru] (in Russian)), we never found the time to write
something down.

In the meantime a lot of stuff has happened though, so it's time to change that
:-)

Note: This blog post is intended for a technical audience that is already
intimately familiar with Nix, and knows what things like derivations or store
paths are. If you're new to Nix, this will not make a lot of sense to you!

## Evaluation regression testing

Most of the evaluator work has been driven by evaluating `nixpkgs`, and ensuring
that we produce the same derivations, and that their results end up in the same
store paths.

Builds are not hooked up all the way to the evaluator yet, but for Nix code
without IFD (such as `nixpkgs`!) we can verify this property without building.
An evaluated Nix derivation's `outPath` (and `drvPath`) can be compared with
what C++ Nix produces for the same code, to determine whether we evaluated the
package (and all of its dependencies!) correctly [^1].

We added integration tests in CI that ensure that the paths we calculate match
C++ Nix, and are successfully evaluating fairly complicated expressions in them.
For example, we test against the Firefox derivation, which exercises some of the
more hairy bits in `nixpkgs` (like WASM cross-compilation infrastructure). Yay!

Although we're avoiding fine-grained optimization until we're sure Tvix
evaluates all of `nixpkgs` correctly, we still want to have an idea about
evaluation performance and how our work affects it over time.

For this we extended our benchmark suite and integrated it with
[Windtunnel][windtunnel], which now regularly runs benchmarks and provides a
view into how the timings change from commit to commit.

In the future, we plan to run this as a part of code review, before changes are
applied to our canonical branch, to provide this as an additional signal to
authors and reviewers without having to run the benchmarks manually.

## ATerms, output path calculation, and `builtins.derivation`

We've implemented all of these features, which comprise the components needed to
construct derivations in the Nix language, and to allow us to perform the path
comparisons we mentioned before.

As an interesting side note, in C++ Nix `builtins.derivation` is not actually a
builtin! It is a piece of [bundled Nix code][nixcpp-builtins-derivation], that
massages some parameters and then calls the *actual* builtin:
`derivationStrict`. We've decided to keep this setup, and implemented support in
in Tvix to have builtins defined in `.nix` source code.

These builtins return attribute sets with the previously mentioned `outPath` and
`drvPath` fields. Implementing them correctly meant that we needed to implement
output path calculation *exactly* the same way as Nix does (bit-by-bit).

Very little of how this output path calculation works is documented anywhere in
C++ Nix. It uses a subset of [ATerm][aterm] internally, produces "fingerprints"
containing hashes of these ATerms, which are then hashed again. The intermediate
hashes are not printed out anywhere (except if you [patch
Nix][nixcpp-patch-hashes] to do so).

We already did parts of this correctly while starting this work on
[go-nix][go-nix-outpath] some while ago, but found some more edge cases and
ultimately came up with a nicer interface for Tvix.

All the Derivation internal data model, ATerm serialization and output path
calculation have been sliced out into a more general-purpose
[nix-compat][nix-compat-derivation] crate, alongside with more documentation
unit tests and a Derivation ATerm parser, so hopefully this will now be more
accessible for everyone now.

Note our builtin does *not* yet persist the Derivation anywhere "on
disk" (though we have a debug CL that does write it to a temporary directory,
in case we want to track down differences).

## `tvix-[ca]store`
Tvix now has a store implementation!

### The Nix model
Inside Nix, store path contents are normally hashed and communicated in NAR
format, which is very coarse and often wasteful - a single bit of change in one
file in a large store path causes a new NAR file to be uploaded to the binary
cache, which then needs to be downloaded.

Additionally, identifying everything by the SHA256 digest of its NAR
representation makes Nix store paths very incompatible with other
content-addressed systems, as it's a very Nix-specific format.

### The more granular Tvix model
After experimenting with some concepts and ideas in Golang, mostly around how to
improve binary cache performance [^3], both on-disk as well as over the network,
we settled on a more granular, content-addressed and general-purpose format.

Internally, it behaves very similar to how git handles tree objects, except
blobs are identified by their raw BLAKE3 digests rather than some custom
encoding, and similarly, tree/directory objects use the BLAKE3 digest of its
canonical protobuf serialization as identifiers.

This provides some immediate benefits:
 - We only need to keep the same data once, even if it's used across different
   store paths.
 - Transfers can be more granular and only need to fetch the data that's
   needed. Due to everything being content-addressed, it can be fetched from
   anything supporting BLAKE3 digests, immediately making it compatible with
   other P2P systems (IPFS blake3 blobs, …), or general-purpose
   content-addressed caches ([bazel-remote]).

There's a lot more details about the data model, certain decisions etc. in
[the docs][castore-docs].

### Compatibility
We however still want to stay compatible with Nix, as in calculating
"NAR-addressed" store paths the same, support substituting from regular Nix
binary caches, as well as storing all the other additional metadata about store
paths.

We accomplished this by splitting the two different concerns into two separate
`tvix-store` and `tvix-castore` crates, with the former one holding all
Nix-specific metadata and functionality, and the latter being a general-purpose
content-addressed blob and filesystem tree storage system, which is usable in a
lot of contexts outside of Tvix too. For example, if you want to use
tvix-castore to write your own git alternative, or provide granular and
authenticated access into large scientific datasets, you could!

### Backends
In addition to a gRPC API and client bindings, there's support for local
filesystem-based backends, as well as for sled, an embedded K/V database.

We're also currently working on a backend supporting most common object
storages, as well as on more granular seeking and content-defined chunking for
blobs.

### FUSE/virtiofs
A tvix-store can be mounted via FUSE, or exposed through virtiofs [^4].
While doing the obvious thing - allowing mounting and browsing the contents
of the store, this will allow lazy substitution of builds on remote builders, be
in containerized or virtualized workloads.

We have an [example][tvix-boot-readme] in the repository seeding gnu hello into
a throwaway store, then booting a MicroVM and executing it.

### nar-bridge, bridging binary caches
`nar-bridge` and the `NixHTTPPathInfoService` bridge `tvix-[ca]store` with
existing Nix binary caches and Nix.

The former exposes a `tvix-[ca]store` over the common Nix HTTP Binary Cache
interface (both read and write).

The latter allows Tvix to substitute from regular Nix HTTP Binary caches,
unpacking NARs and ingesting them on-the-fly into the castore model.
The necessary parsers for NARInfo, signatures etc are also available in the
[nix-compat crate][nix-compat-narinfo].

## EvalIO / builtins interacting with the store more closely
tvix-eval itself is designed to be quite pure when it comes to IO - it doesn't
do any IO directly on its own, but for the very little IO functionality it
does as part of "basic interaction with paths"[^2] (like importing other
`.nix` files), it goes through an `EvalIO` interface, which is provided to the
Evaluator struct on instantiation.

This allows us to be a bit more flexible with how IO looks like in practice,
which becomes interesting for specific store implementations that might not
expose a POSIX filesystem directly, or targets where we don't have a filesystem
at all (like WASM).

Using the `EvalIO` trait also allows avoiding the `tvix-eval` crate to get too
strongly coupled to a specific store implementation, hashing scheme etc [^2].
As we can extend the set of builtins available to the evaluator with "foreign
builtins", these can live in other crates.

Following this pattern, we started implementing some of the "basic" builtins
that deal with path access in `tvix-eval`, like:

 - `builtins.pathExists`
 - `builtins.readFile`

We also recently started working on more complicated builtins like
`builtins.filterSource` and `builtins.path`, which are also used in `nixpkgs`.

Both import a path into the store, and allow passing a Nix expression that's
used as a filter function for each path. `builtins.path` can also ensuring the
imported contents match a certain hash.

This required the builtin to interact with the store and evaluator in a very
tight fashion, as the filter function (written in Nix) needs to be repeatedly
executed for each path, and its return value is able to cause the store to skip
over certain paths (which it previously couldn't).

Getting the abstractions right there required some back-and-forth, but the
remaining changes should land quite soon.

## Catchables / tryEval

As you may know, Nix has a limited exception system for dealing with
user-generated errors: `builtins.tryEval` can be used to detect if an expression
fails (if `builtins.throw` or `assert` are used to generate it). This feature
requires extra support in any Nix implementation, as errors may not necessarily
cause the Nix program to abort.

The C++ Nix implementation just reuses the C++ language-provided Exception
system for `builtins.tryEval` which Tvix can't (even if Rust had an equivalent
system):
In C++ Nix the runtime representation of the program in execution corresponds
to the Nix expression tree of the relevant source files. This means that an
exception raised in C++ code will automatically bubble up correctly since the
C++ and Nix call stacks are equivalent to each other.
Tvix compiles the Nix expressions to a byte code program which may be mutated
by extra optimization rules (for example, we hope to eliminate as many thunks as
possible in the future). This means that such a correspondence between Nix and
the (in this case) VM runtime is not guaranteed.

Previously, `builtins.tryEval` (which is implemented in Rust and can access VM
internals) just allowed the VM to recover from certain kinds of errors. This
proved to be insufficient as it [blew up as soon as a `builtins.tryEval`-ed thunk
is forced again][tryeval-infrec]—extra bookkeeping was needed. As a
solution, we now store thunk evaluation errors that can be recovered from as
`Value::Catchable` which mitigates this problem.

As you can imagine, storing evaluation failures as "normal" values quickly leads
to all sorts of bugs because most VM/builtins code is written with only ordinary
values like attribute sets, strings etc. in mind.
While ironing those out, we made sure to supplement those fixes with as many
test cases for `builtins.tryEval` as possible. This will hopefully prevent any
regressions if or rather when we touch this system again. We already have some
ideas for replacing the `Catchable` value type with a cleaner representation.

## String contexts

For a long time, we had the [working theory][refscan-string-contexts] that we
could get away with not implementing string contexts, and instead do reference
scanning on a set of "known paths" (and not implement
`builtins.unsafeDiscardStringContext`).

Unfortunately, we discovered that while this is *conceptually* true, due to a
[bug in Nix][string-contexts-nix-bug] that's worked around in the
`stdenv.mkDerivation` implementation, we can't currently do this and calculate
the same hashes.

Because hash compatibility is important for us at this point, we bit the bullet
and added support for string contexts into our `NixString` implementation,
implemented the context-related builtins, and added more unit tests that verify
string context behaviour of various builtins.

## Strings as bstr

C++ Nix uses C-style zero-terminated strings internally - however, until
recently, Tvix has used Rust `String` and `str` for string values. Since those
are required to be valid utf-8, we haven't been able to properly represent all
the string values that Nix supports.

We recently converted our internal representation to byte strings, which allows
us to treat a `Vec<u8>` as a "string-like" value.

## JSON/TOML/XML

We added support for the `toJSON`, `toXML`, `fromJSON` and `fromTOML` builtins.

`toXML` is particularly exciting, as it's the only format that allows expressing
(partially applied) functions. It's also used in some of Nix' own test suite, so
we can now include these in our unit test suite (and pass, yay!).

## Builder protocol, drv->builder

We've been working on the builder protocol, and Tvix's internal build
representation.

Nix uses derivations (encoded in ATerm) as nodes in its build graph, but it
refers to other store paths used in that build by these store paths *only*. As
mentioned before, store paths only address the inputs - and not the content.

This poses a big problem in Nix as soon as builds are scheduled on remote
builders: There is no guarantee that files at the same store path on the remote
builder actually have the same contents as on the machine orchestrating the
build. If a package is not binary reproducible, this can lead to so-called
[frankenbuilds][frankenbuild].

This also introduces a dependency on the state that's present on the remote
builder machine: Whatever is in its store and matches the paths will be used,
even if it was maliciously placed there.

To eliminate this hermiticity problem and increase the integrity of builds,
we've decided to use content-addressing in the builder protocol.

We're currently hacking on this at [Thaigersprint](https://thaigersprint.org/)
and might have some more news to share soon!

That's it for now, try out Tvix and hit us up on IRC or on our mailing list if
you run into any snags, or have any questions.
