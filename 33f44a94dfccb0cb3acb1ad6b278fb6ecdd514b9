      "message": "Currently in //default.nix there is a facility for introducing a nixpkgs-related impurity (injecting a nixpkgs path for bisecting). On second thought, for something as fundamental as nixpkgs itself we may want to keep control of these impurities at the top-level (i.e. pass it in via externalArgs in //default.nix).\n\nThis is because, in general, I\u0027d like to move depot towards being able to do things like overriding `builtins.getEnv` to an error to make things more self-contained.\n\nWould be curious to hear grfn\u0027s thoughts, too.",
