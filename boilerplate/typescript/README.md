# Frontend Boilerplate

While many times I prefer using alt-languages like ReasonML, ClojureScript, or
Elm, sometimes I prefer to write an application using TypeScript. This directory
contains the necessary starter code to create these applications.

- React: Maps application state to UI
- React-Router: Stateful routing for SPAs
- Redux: Application state management
- TypeScript: Type-safety
- TailwindCSS: Styling library using utility classes
- Prettier: Source code formatting
- Jest: Test runner

## Developing

```shell
