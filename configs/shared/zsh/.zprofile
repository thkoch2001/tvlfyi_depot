# ZSH seems to avoid sourcing ~/.profile during SSH sessions.
# X (or something else) seems to source ~/.profile with it initializes.
# Putting this here allows my SSH sessions to have the expected configuration.
#
# Putting this here instead of in my .zshrc or .zshenv is advantageous since it
# is only called once when a terminal is created; subshells and nested ZSH
# sessions don't re-source this file.
