# It might be possible to attempt to share KBDs between `lf` and `dired`.
# Currently shared KBDs with `dired`:
#   - D: delete file
#   - R: rename file
#   - +: create directory
#   - c: create file
#
# The following command prefixes are used by lf (taken from the docs):
#
#    :  read (default)  builtin/custom command
#    $  shell           shell command
#    %  shell-pipe      shell command running with the ui
#    !  shell-wait      shell command waiting for key press
#    &  shell-async     shell command running asynchronously
#    /  search          search file in current directory
#    ?  search-back     search file in the reverse order

# TODO: move most of these commands to function.zsh and call those functions
# herein. Especially the `archive` and `extract` functions.
#
# TODO: consider integrations with `xdg-open` and configuring filetypes to
# behave in expected "dwim" ways.
#
# TODO: learn more about the terms "archive", "compress", "decompress",
# "expand", "extract", etc. See if a larger abstraction can be created on top
# without sacrificing too much nuance. This might be the case of "serialize",
# "deserialize", "pickle", "unpickle", "marshal", "unmarshal", "encode",
# "decode" -- in which case, a broader abstraction would be nice to decrease the
# surface area of the vocabulary.
#
# TODO: find a way to visualize all of the bound or unbound KBDs.
#
# TODO: support polymorphic way encrypt/decrypt a file or directory.
#
# TODO: support "toggle" for encryption/decryption that detects which function
# to run based on the extension.
#
# TODO: support "toggle" for archive/unarchive that detects which function to
# run based on the extension.
