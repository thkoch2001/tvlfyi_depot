  "Hello!

My name is William Carroll. I'm currently attempting a ladder switch. I have my
manager's approval to look for a new role because we believe I have been hired
for the wrong position.

I'm eager to move ahead if there are any SRE openings in LON that fit my
profile. I'm happy to share more information with you about my background and
what I'm looking for. I've been attending the SRE Ops Review meetings in 6PS
weekly for awhile now, so we should be in the same office every Tuesday if
meeting in person is easier for you.

Let me know!"
