Is it safe to say that every cycle will contain a `Value::Thunk`?\n\nI used `Rc::new_cyclic` in `prepare_globals()`, but that one particular cycle is okay to leak.\n\nWhat I\u0027m getting at here is that we might be able to get away with just tracing `Thunk`-cycles somehow.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is right... a `SuspendedNative` is basically a Rust closure, which could capture references to `Value`s.  In fact, `prepare_global()` actually does this!  It captures a (weak) reference to the `GlobalsMap`, whose values are `Value`s.\n\nI think we are going to need to expose a trait for suspended native functions, and have it be a subtrait of `Trace`.  A `ThunkRepr::Native` isn\u0027t \"just a Rust function\" anymore; now it is \"a Rust function that knows how to `Trace` any `Value` references it has captured\".",
