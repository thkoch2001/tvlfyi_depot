      "message": "This is great, and I totally understand that hand-writing the marshalling code is a lot less work than creating a generator.\n\nBut I can\u0027t really vouch for the correctness of this code... I tried reading it and promptly fell asleep.  That\u0027s not a criticism, it\u0027s just the nature of handwritten marshalling code.  You\u0027ll get two kinds of reviewers: the ones who admit they can\u0027t vouch for it, and the ones that lie. ðŸ˜Š\n\nAnyways this is really useful, so we should merge it.",
