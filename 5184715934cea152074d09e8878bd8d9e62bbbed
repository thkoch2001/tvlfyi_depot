      "message": "@tazjin Let me know what you think of this trait trampoline.\n\nI initially started to implement NAR rendering directly in the `calculate_nar` handler of SledPathInfoService, but this made it not very reusable, and passing in clients to the other services, and testing/mocking became very messy.\n\nAt least when invoking the calculate_nar() RPC method, we can assume that the connected Directory and BlobStores are local to the thing replying to the calculate_nar request, and everything queried is already present - so we don\u0027t need the more powerful recursive fetching methods.\n\nIt\u0027s not yet working in the following CL, but I was expecting to use this trait, or something similar in the calculate_nar rpc method implementation.",
