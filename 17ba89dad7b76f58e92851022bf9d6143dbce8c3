I think amjoseph is also gonna do a review, but unless grfn shows up the chances of someone more experienced doing a review is very slim :p\n\nI think if I get 2 +1s, I\u0027ll count it as a +2 and move on with it. Things are always fixable later and I\u0027ve already gotten a lot of good feedback on this!",
