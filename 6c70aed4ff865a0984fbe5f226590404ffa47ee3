Before I could make it into a CL I just got really bad tennis elbow and had to stop using a computer and phone. That was 2 months ago.\n\nMine has enum support (it errors if you don\u0027t use enum that matches the protocol version) as well as serializing using into, try_into and display traits.",

So if you want to take over or at least look at what I have locally I can arrange that and get it into a couple of CLs. I can also do pair programming as long as I don\u0027t have to use mouse or keyboard a bunch.\n\nIf you are not interested in that I will review this CL as it stands.",
