Systemd says it\u0027s running, but in reality the weird architecture of Keycloak is loading a gajillion JARs at runtime before being able to actually do anything.\n\nWe already have After\u003d and Wants\u003d, I\u0027m not sure what BindsTo\u003d would give us in addition. Restarting oauth2_proxy if Keycloak is restarted? I don\u0027t think that gives us anything.",
