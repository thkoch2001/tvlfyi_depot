      "message": "You\u0027re right about that, the naming comes from the previous setup where we had to have two different call*-functions to handle calls returning a value to the *same* chunk and resuming execution, and functions calls that apply at the end of their chunk.\n\nThere\u0027s no reason for this function to be named like this anymore, it is just `call_value`. I\u0027ll fix it at the top of the chain.",
