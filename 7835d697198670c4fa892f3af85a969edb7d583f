      "message": "It has a test in the test suite, so if we don\u0027t add it we should do all of the following: (a) disable the test (b) make sure we remember why we disabled it (c) ensure that nixpkgs does not inadvertently introduce new uses of this builtin.\n\nI\u0027m fine with either solution, but we have to pick one or the other.  I figured just implementing it was easier than (a)+(b)+(c).\n\nMy understanding is that we omit support for things that *nixpkgs has a policy against ever using*.",
