      "message": "This is mostly a PoC to demonstrate crate2nix now working for webassembly, which I\u0027m pretty hyped about, thanks @personal@ilanjoselevich.com ðŸŽ‰.\n\nTvixbolt is a good demo candidate. It doesn\u0027t have to be part of the workspace technically, but the crate2nix UX is quite bad when referring to \"out-of-workspace, but in-repo and please gitignore-fltered\" crates.\nIf you want to keep using the old building approach for it, and keep it outside the workspace, that also fine.\n\nHowever, there\u0027s gonna be other web frontends for tvix-store/tvix-build which I\u0027d like to see being shipped/served with/from tvix-store or tvix-build directly, and these would need to live inside //tvix.\n\nThis is likely gonna stay drafted at least until the nixpkgs fixes landed. The commit message has been updated to provide some context.",
