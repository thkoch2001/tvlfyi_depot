# Backports Elm packages for Elm 0.18 from an older channel of
# nixpkgs.
#
# Elm 0.19 changed the language & package ecosystem completely,
# essentially requiring a partial rewrite of all Elm apps. However,
# //fun/gemma uses Elm 0.18 and I don't have time to rewrite it.
#
# Since the ABIs of current glibc and the pinned version have diverged
# too much, we need to build //fun/gemma completely based on a historical
# nixpkgs version.
