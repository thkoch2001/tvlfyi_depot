# Filing a Nix issue

*WAIT* Are you sure you're filing your issue in the right repository?

We appreciate you taking the time to tell us about issues you encounter, but routing the issue to the right place will get you help sooner and save everyone time.

This is the Nix repository, and issues here should be about Nix the build and package management *_tool_*.

If you have a problem with a specific package on NixOS or when using Nix, you probably want to file an issue with _nixpkgs_, whose issue tracker is over at https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues.

Examples of _Nix_ issues:

- Nix segfaults when I run `nix-build -A blahblah`
- The Nix language needs a new builtin: `builtins.foobar`
- Regression in the behavior of `nix-env` in Nix 2.0

Examples of _nixpkgs_ issues:

- glibc is b0rked on aarch64
- chromium in NixOS doesn't support U2F but google-chrome does!
- The OpenJDK package on macOS is missing a key component

Chances are if you're a newcomer to the Nix world, you'll probably want the [nixpkgs tracker](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues). It also gets a lot more eyeball traffic so you'll probably get a response a lot more quickly.
