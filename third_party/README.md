Third-Party Code
================

Code under this folder is one of the following:

1. Externally developed dependencies which have been imported ("vendored") into
   this repository. These dependencies come with their own licenses and whatever
   else.

2. Code that is developed inside of this repository, but released to an external
   repository via [Copybara][].

=======
# third_party

The `third_party` directory hosts Nix expressions that package software that I
cannot or have not found in other Nix package repositorys like `nixpkgs` or
`depot`.
