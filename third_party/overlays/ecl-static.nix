  # pkgsStatic), so we're gonna use this override for now.

  # Note that ecl-static does mean that we have things
  # statically linked against GMP and ECL which are LGPL.
  # I believe this should be alright: The way ppl are gonna
  # interact with the distributed binaries (i. e. the binary
  # cache) is Nix in the depot monorepo, so the separability
  # requirement should be satisfied: Source code or overriding
  # would be available as ways to swap out the used GMP in the
  # program.
