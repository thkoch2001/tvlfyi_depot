paroxysm
========

`paroxysm` is a bot for [internet relay chat (IRC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
that lets you store small pieces of information,
called *factoids*, and retrieve them later. It's useful for organising frequently-used information
to avoid repeating oneself in a busy chatroom, as well as making little todo lists or notes to self
in a private chatroom.

It was directly inspired by the [LearnDB](https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/learndb.md) functionality
offered in `##crawl` on chat.freenode.net, and uses similar syntax.

## Usage instructions

Will come soon; the project is very much still in beta, and is subject to change.
