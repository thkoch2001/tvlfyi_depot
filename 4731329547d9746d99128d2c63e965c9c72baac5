We can\u0027t tie the lifetime of stuff like bytecode to the lifetime of the VM without everything being either an incredible headache or unsafe, so this is not a future-proof API.\n\nWe should split `Value` into two: There\u0027s a value that contains internal variants (like `Thunk`, various stack markers, all normal Nix types, etc.) and an external value (Nix types, token values for things like \"This is unevaluated\" which you *can\u0027t do anything more with*).\n\nUsers need to specify how far they want things to be evaluated when first calling the evaluation.",

      "message": "@tazjin@tvl.su How do you suggest to implement things that needs to incrementally decide how far to go in the evaluation? Or things like I want something in-between a shallow force and a deep force, e.g. forcing `meta`, `drvPath`, `outPath` for example for a derivation, but not `passthru` necessarily?",

      "message": "Please take a (careful) look at https://github.com/nix-community/nix-eval-jobs/blob/main/src/worker.cc ; are you suggesting that an `builtins.evalJobs` builtin should be created, and this one should *stream* JSON*L* in the VM?\n\nI understand the desire to avoid leaking internal Values from a VM but if this is opaque and transmitted to _another_ VM. You wrote \"tying the lifetime of stuff like bytecode to the lifetime of the VM\", but this is false? The VM can be torn down once you get the `Value` back. Yes, the bytecode needs to be around, though.\n\nSo, I am not yet convinced that the only way to control and drive an evaluation usefully is via a builtin or by being _inside_ a VM generator, but I agree that the solution implemented here is neither desirable, this is just a nice hack to work on getting tvix-eval-jobs right on many aspects.",
