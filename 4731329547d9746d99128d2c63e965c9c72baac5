We can\u0027t tie the lifetime of stuff like bytecode to the lifetime of the VM without everything being either an incredible headache or unsafe, so this is not a future-proof API.\n\nWe should split `Value` into two: There\u0027s a value that contains internal variants (like `Thunk`, various stack markers, all normal Nix types, etc.) and an external value (Nix types, token values for things like \"This is unevaluated\" which you *can\u0027t do anything more with*).\n\nUsers need to specify how far they want things to be evaluated when first calling the evaluation.",
