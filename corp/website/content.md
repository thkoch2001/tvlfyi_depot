Welcome to the corporate face of [The Virus Lounge][tvl-fyi].

We provide technology consulting around a variety of topics, for
example:

* Advice and setup of organisation-wide monorepos for effective
  developer workflows, including associated tooling like CI/CD
* Assistance with anything related to Nix/NixOS
* Software development in various languages (Rust, Common Lisp,
  Erlang, Java and more)

We also provide some services on this page:

* [tvixbolt][], a web-frontend for the [Tvix][] evaluator
* ... and other services listed on the community homepage

We might be able to help you with other things on request.

Note: We are still in the process of getting started and have limited
capacity at the moment. If you would like our help, please reach out
