      "message": "This seems like the bulk of things here, and is the thing I\u0027m least clear on how it\u0027s going to happen - specifically, is the idea that every host would have credentials to clone the depot? or would we have some sort of metadata service for fetching the current outPath of a particular depot build taarget? The latter seems kinda cool (albeit unfortunately pretty mutability-based), but I\u0027m moderately worried about the overhead of the former. Maybe it\u0027s fine though",
