      "message": "Disagree, I don\u0027t think this has to be a sterile post without any personal notes. Rust truly is *natural* here in several ways, in order of importance:\n\n- It\u0027s probably the language best known by TVL contributors (esp. the ones working on tvix-eval).\n\n- It\u0027s probably the most popular \u0026 well-known language in the community of people who write Nix tooling.\n\n- It is actually the only modern language I can think of you would write something like an evaluator in. Sure, the \"modern\" qualifier does a lot of work - but starting a project of this size in C is insane, and in C++ unthinkable (unless you\u0027re a big organisation with massive C++ legacy). So what remains? Zig? I don\u0027t even think that\u0027s a finished language yet.\n\nSo yeah, I do think it\u0027s natural, and it\u0027s a post with my name on it and I would definitely say this.",
